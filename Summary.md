## 1. Which tasks you used Claude/Codex for
- The whole implementation of the project, including:
  - Analysis  
  - Planning  
  - Solutioning  
  - Implementation  
  - Code implementation  
  - Testing, debugging, and running the app  

## 2. What output you accepted or modified
- Accepted every output Claude suggested after reviewing it.
- Modified types from libraries that Claude attempted to install but did not exist.

## 3. How AI affected your speed or code quality
- Code development was **very fast** after the initial phases of Analysis, Planning, and Solutioning, which consumed most of the time.
- Code quality was **good**.

## 4. What custom settings you have made (if any)
- Added custom instructions to save all prompts.

## 5. What problems you handled during the development
- Needed to ask the model to save frequently due to fast context limits being reached every few hours.
- Encountered UI bugs that the model couldn’t track without MCPs.
- Minor hallucinations about packages that were agreed not to be used.
- Imports generated by the model sometimes referenced types that did not exist in the actual libraries.
